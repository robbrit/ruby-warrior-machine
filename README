Description
===========

The creators of an evolutionary program engine called Avida (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida)
discovered that certain assembly languages are more robust to random mutation
and cross-over than others. The RubyWarriorMachine project applies this idea
to play the RubyWarrior game (https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior) by generating
and selecting RubyWarriorMachines that are able to play this game well.

Requirements
============

This program requires RubyWarrior:

  gem install rubywarrior


Usage
=====

1) Generate a program:

  ruby gen_program.rb

2) Run the program:

  ruby runner.rb

This will not display anything for a while if the robot ends up just wandering
aimlessly. The engine will quit after 100 actions (the robot should figure out
what to do by then) however this does not guarantee that the program will end.
